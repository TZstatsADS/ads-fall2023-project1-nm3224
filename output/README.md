# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

+ ```processed_moments.csv``` is created and saved by running the file ```Text_Processing.Rmd``` located inside the ```doc``` folder of this repository. However, I have already ran and included that code here for you, so to save you the time and you may access it directly. This is the processed and cleaned text, with stop-words removed, and text made lowercase.
