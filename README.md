### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: How Romantic Relationships Impact Happiness Across Genders. 
+ This project is conducted by Noreen Mayat

+ Project summary: In this project, I explore how romantic relationships, experiences and interactions impact happiness across gender groups of male and female, through computing the average word frequency for a bag of "romance"-related words for male and female, word2vec, and sentiment analysis. I found that male happiness appears to be more related to romantic experiences and relationships than female happiness; "partner" was a topic more correlated to happiness for males than for females; and on avergae, of all mentions of partner words, males seem to reference their partners and romantic experiences more when prompted about their "happy moments" than women; and males have overall higher sentiment scores for documents discussing happiness than women.
